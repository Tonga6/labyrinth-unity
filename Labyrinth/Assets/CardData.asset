  - I hear screams in the distance. I wonder what brought that poor soul down here.
  - 'The ground has turned slick with blood and the screams are only a feeble moan
    now. '
  - I have found a mangled body, his chest torn open. Whatever did this is still
    in here with me. Footsteps follow me now.
  - If monsters are all that stand between me and the Architect's Workshop I will
    count myself lucky.
  - The beast is close now. I am ready for whatever emerges from the shadows.
  - I have slain the monster. It was a minotaur made of brass and steel. A replacement
    for the original?
  - A large door needing two keys blocks my way. The Architect's workshop must lie
    beyond.
  - The minotaur's brass horns were the key. How could anyone beyond this door ever
    leave with the minotaur locked outside?
  - The door leads to a cold and dark forge. Someone mutters to themselves in the
    dark. The Architect?
  - Engravings cover this place. They all resemble a set of wings, each design a
    little different from the others.
  - The forge leads to a library, bigger than any I have seen. The inscriptions continue
    here.
  - The muttering has lead me to an old, frail man. He scratches into the floor with
    jagged nails.     Is this the Architect?
  - He handed me an idol of Zeus when I approached, but pays me no more attention.
    What am I to do with this?
  - It is clear I cannot coax any advice from him. His gift must lead to the river
    if I am clever enough.
  - I leave the Architect to his strange work and proceed through this cold and quiet
    place. I see the exit up ahead.
  - 'Before me now is a vast bridge that leads into darkness. I have no choice but
    to cross. '
  - I hear a rumbling that comes from far below. Another monster? Or something worse.
  - My body is failing. If it is another monster I don't know if I will survive.
  - Focusing on the noise below helps to distract me from my growing doubt.
  - 'It sounds familiar, doesn''t it? I''ve heard it before... Where have I heard
    it? '
  - At the crossroads, a lifetime ago... The crossroads beside the river...
  - Is the river truely beneath me? What if the sound is just a figment of my imagination?
  - But, the Architect's gift... The idol... An offering of faith... I must have
    faith.
  - There is no difference if the river lies below or the endless void. I am free
    at last.
