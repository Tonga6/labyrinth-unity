  - I hear screams in the distance. The sort that
  - I notice that the ground has turned slick with blood as I journey deeper. The
    screams have stopped.
  - 'I have found the source of the blood. A mangled body leans against the wall,
    his chest torn open. Whatever did this is still in here with me. '
  - Footsteps have followed me ever since I came upon the body. Its killer follows
    my trail in the darkness.
  - The footsteps grow louder. I am ready for whatever emerges from the shadows.
  - The monster was a minotaur made of brass and machinery. I killed it like any
    monster, if such a thing can be done to machine. Was this pale imitation the
    work of the Architect?
  - An intricate door that requires two keys blocks my way. The Architect's workshop
    must lie beyond this door.
  - The minotaur had what I needed. Its horns were the key.
  - Beyond the door is a cavernous library. Endless rows of shelves, each stretching
    towards the ceiling and out of view. The Architect must be here.
  - Will he know how to find the river? What if it doesn't flow through this place?
  - There is a reading candle beside this bookshelf. Its wax is still hot. Someone
    was here recently.
  - I have noticed that the floor is covered in markings everywhere I walk. Drawings
    of some design, each a little different to the rest. Each drawing resembles a
    pair of wings.
  - 'I finally found the Architect. He is muttering to himself while he carves another
    pair of wings onto the ground. '
  - When I approached he handed me a bowl of libations. He pays me no more attention
    despite my best effort.
  - I'm afraid to leave without understanding the purpose of this bowl, but I dare
    not risk the Architect ire by pestering him further. I will leave the Architect
    to his work and continue on my way.
  - I have come to another door. This one opens without resistance.
  - On the other to a vast bridge that continues into the nothingness. I have no
    option but to cross it with my libations.
  - I don't know how long I have been walking this bridge. The workshop is already
    a distant memory.
  - There is a noise coming from far below. Another monster? Or something worse.
  - I find myself slipping in and out of consciousness. There is only the sound of
    my footsteps and the abyss below.
  - "That rumbling\u2026 I can't shake the thought... Doesn't it sounds like water?
    It can't be."
  - It must be. It must be the river. It has been below me this entire time.
  - I pour my libations over the edge and watch it fall. An offering of faith. I
    must have faith.
  - There is no fear, no doubt. What does it matter whether it is the river beneath
    me or the endless void? The result is the same.
