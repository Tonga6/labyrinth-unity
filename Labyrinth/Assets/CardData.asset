  - I hear screams in the distance. Are they real? I wonder if they came here looking
    for the River too.
  - The ground has turned slick with blood and the screams have turned to whimpers.
  - I have found a mangled body, his chest torn open. Whatever did this is still
    in here with me.
  - Footsteps follow me now. If monsters are all that stand between me and the River
    I will count myself lucky.
  - Clashing metal echoes the halls. The monster must be close.
  - I have slain the monster. It was a minotaur made of brass and steel. A replacement
    for the original?
  - A large door needing two keys blocks my way. The Architect's Workshop must lie
    beyond.
  - The minotaur's brass horns were the keys. How could anyone beyond this door ever
    leave with the minotaur locked outside?
  - The door leads to a cold and dark forge. I think someone mutters in the dark.
  - Engravings cover every surface. They resemble sets of wings, each design a little
    different from the others.
  - A faint light flickers in the distance. The first sign of light I have seen in
    a long time.
  - The light has lead me to an old, frail man. He scratches designs into the floor
    with jagged nails.
  - He handed me an idol of Hera when I approached, but pays me no more attention.
    What am I to do with this?
  - The irony is not lost on me that the Architect's gift should depict her of all
    gods.
  - I leave the Architect to his obsession. I trust the meaning of his gift will
    come to me.
  - The workshop leads to a vast bridge that leads into darkness. I have no choice
    but to cross.
  - A rumbling that comes from far below. Another monster? Or something worse.
  - I feel my body starting to fail me now. If it is another monster I don't know
    if I will survive.
  - Focusing on the noise below helps to distract me from my growing doubt.
  - 'It sounds familiar, doesn''t it? I''ve heard it before... Where have I heard
    it? '
  - At the crossroads, a lifetime ago... The crossroads beside the river...
  - Could it be? What if the sound is just a figment of my imagination? Or what if
    it isn't really the river?
  - But, the Architect's gift... The idol... An offering of faith... I must have
    faith.
  - I step to the edge... The outcome will be the same whether the river lies below
    or the endless abyss.
