11, "I hear screams in the distance. The sort that "
12, "I notice that the ground has turned slick with blood as I journey deeper. The screams have stopped." 
13, "I have found the source of the blood. A mangled body leans against the wall, his chest torn open. Whatever did this is still in here with me. 
14, "Footsteps have followed me ever since I came upon the body. Its killer follows my trail in the darkness."
15, "The footsteps grow louder. I am ready for whatever emerges from the shadows."
16, "The monster was a minotaur made of brass and machinery. I killed it like any monster, if such a thing can be done to machine. Was this pale imitation the work of the Architect?
17, "A door blocks my way. It is locked by some clever mechanism that I cannot understand and requries two strangely-shaped key that I do not possess. The Architect's workshop must lie beyond this door.
18, "The minotaur held the key. I returned to where I left it and found its horns had a jagged design unlike the rest of its body. Each horn fit a keyhole perfectly.
21, "Beyond the door is a cavernous library. Endless rows of shelves, each stretching towards the ceiling and out of view. The Architect must be here.
22, "Will he know how to find the river? What if it doesn't flow through this place?"
23, "There is a reading candle beside this bookshelf. Its wax is still hot. Someone was here recently."
24, "I have noticed that the floor is covered in markings everywhere I walk. Drawings of some design, each a little different to the rest. Each drawing resembles a pair of wings.
25, "I finally found the Architect. He is muttering to himself while he carves another pair of wings onto the ground. 
26, "When I approached he handed me a bowl of libations. He pays me no more attention despite my best effort.
27, "I'm afraid to leave without understanding the purpose of this bowl, but I dare not risk the Architect ire by pestering him further. I will leave the Architect to his work and continue on my way.
28, "I have come to another door. This one opens without resistance."
31, "On the other to a vast bridge that continues into the nothingness. I have no option but to cross it with my libations.
32, "I don't know how long I have been walking this bridge. The workshop is already a distant memory.
33, "There is a noise coming from far below. Another monster? Or something worse.
34, "I find myself slipping in and out of consciousness. There is only the sound of my footsteps and the abyss below.
35, "That rumblingâ€¦ I can't shake the thought... Doesn't it sounds like water? It can't be.
36, "It must be. It must be the river. It has been below me this entire time.
37, "I pour my libations over the edge and watch it fall. An offering of faith. I must have faith."
38,"There is no fear, no doubt. What does it matter whether it is the river beneath me or the endless void? The result is the same."
